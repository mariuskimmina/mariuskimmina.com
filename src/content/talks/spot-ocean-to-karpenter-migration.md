# From Spot Ocean to Karpenter - Zero Downtime Migration

In this talk I discuss one of the biggest infrastructure migrations that I've lead thus far, moving from Spot Ocean to Karpenter.
I talk about how managed a seamless migration, our current setup for running Karpenter and why we build a custom controller to fix broken nodes.
