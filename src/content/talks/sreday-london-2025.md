# Infrastructure as Software: Rethinking Cloud Architecture

This was my first tech conference talk at SREday London 2025. I explored how we can move beyond traditional Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approaches to treat infrastructure as true software, enabling better testing, composition, and maintainability.

## Talk Overview

The talk covered:
- The limitations of current IaC tools and practices
- How to apply software engineering principles to infrastructure
- Practical examples of infrastructure testing and composition
- Tools and techniques for managing infrastructure like application code

## Key Takeaways

1. **Testing Infrastructure**: Just like application code, infrastructure should be unit tested, integration tested, and have proper CI/CD pipelines
2. **Composition over Configuration**: Building reusable infrastructure components that can be composed together
3. **Type Safety**: Using strongly-typed languages for infrastructure to catch errors early
4. **Developer Experience**: Making infrastructure changes as easy as application changes

The conference had a great atmosphere with cozy cinema rooms and minimal vendor presence, making it perfect for deep technical discussions.
